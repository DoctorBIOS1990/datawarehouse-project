This was a final assignment, as far as we had time to see about the subject, due to time constraints.

# ðŸ§  Problematic

It is required to determine from the historical records recorded in Excel files for seven years on the sales of three agricultural markets in the city of Santiago de Cuba:</br></br>
â€¢ What are the most sold products in each agricultural market in Santiago de Cuba?</br>
â€¢ Which is the market with the highest total sales?</br>
â€¢ Are there identifiable trends or patterns in the sales of products in the agricultural markets?</br></br>
To do this, the extraction and transformation of the sales data of products in different measures (pounds, kg and quintals) to kg must be performed, and then this data must be loaded into a multidimensional database in MySQL or PostgreSQL.</br>
This will allow analysts to identify the most popular products in each market and make informed decisions about marketing strategies and inventory management.
